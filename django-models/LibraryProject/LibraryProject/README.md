    Introduction to Django and Web Frameworks
    Hello and welcome to my Django project! ðŸŽ‰

    This project was part of my exploration of Django, a popular web framework for building web applications quickly and with clean design.
    In this project, I learned the basics of Djangoâ€™s Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and how to use it to interact with a database.

    I had quite the learning curve, but Iâ€™m excited to share what Iâ€™ve built so far!

-- Project Overview
    This project demonstrates how to:

    Set up a Django project and create an app
    Define models (in this case, a Book model) and map them to database tables
    Use Djangoâ€™s ORM to perform CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) on the database
    Understand how the ORM abstracts away SQL, making database interactions smoother and more Pythonic


    Current Features:
    Book Model:

    The app includes a Book model with three attributes:
    title: The book's title
    author: The book's author
    publication_year: The year the book was published
    You can create, read, update, and delete entries in the Books table using Djangoâ€™s built-in ORM features.
    CRUD Operations:
    Iâ€™ve tested and documented various CRUD operations on the Book model using Django's interactive shell. 
    


    Final Thoughts:
    This project has been a fun challenge, and thereâ€™s still a lot more to learn about Django. 
    I look forward to continuing this journey and adding more functionality to this app. 
    Thanks for checking it out, and I hope you enjoy exploring it!
